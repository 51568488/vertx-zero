# Example One: Single Rpc

In zero system, the developer could focus on code logical instead of Rpc internally, this example will describe Rpc development for micro service communication. For environment preparing, please refer following document

* [2.3 - Micro Service Environment](/doc/23-micro-service-environment.md)
* [10.1 - Rpc Configuration](/doc/101-rpc-configuration.md)

Then you can write your code in zero service.
